Currency Rates
==============

Description
-----------

Currency Rates is an Android widget which helps you to keep track on exchange
rates provided by your bank. It lets you know when the exchange rate has changed
and shows you additional informations of the change.

If you are missing your favorite bank in the list, let me know and I will try to
add it. All the source codes are available at this project page so if you feel
like a Java programmer, you can try to add it by yourself. If you do so, please,
do not forget to share the patch with us here.
