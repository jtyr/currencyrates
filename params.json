{"name":"Currency Rates","tagline":"Android application","body":"# Description\r\n\r\nCurrency Rates is an Android widget which helps you to keep track on exchange rates provided by your bank. It lets you know when the exchange rate has changed and shows you additional information of the change.\r\n\r\nIf you are missing your favorite bank in the list, let me know and I will try to add it. All the source codes are available at this project page so if you feel like a Java programmer, you can try to add it by yourself. If you do so, please, do not forget to share the patch with us here.\r\n\r\n![QR Code](http://currencyrates.googlecode.com/svn/screenshots/qrcode.png)\r\n\r\n# List of supported banks\r\n* [Raiffeisen Bank (CZ)](http://www.rb.cz)\r\n* [UniCredit Bank (CZ)](http://www.unicreditbank.cz)\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Desktop view](http://currencyrates.googlecode.com/svn/screenshots/desktop.png)\r\n![Action list](http://currencyrates.googlecode.com/svn/screenshots/action_list.png)\r\n![Overview screen](http://currencyrates.googlecode.com/svn/screenshots/overview.png)\r\n![Custom Spinner component](http://currencyrates.googlecode.com/svn/screenshots/tolerance.png)\r\n![Settings](http://currencyrates.googlecode.com/svn/screenshots/settings.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
